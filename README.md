A lightweight JavaScript tool that converts Markdown text into colorful SVG mind maps for rendering on the client or server side. It is designed to be self-contained and easy to use, with no external dependencies.<br>

Demo: https://js.mindmapwizard.com

<br>

## Features
- Parses simple Markdown headings and lists into a hierarchical mind map.
- Optimized for light and dark mode use.
- Renders to SVG for crisp visuals and easy styling.
- Minimal, dependency-free code.


<br>

This project was heavily inspired by markmap (https://github.com/markmap/markmap). See that project for a more feature-rich implementation and more functionality.
